        <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: Rock (a fist), Paper (an open hand), or Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The winner is determined by the basic rules: Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins), Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins), and Paper covers Rock (Paper wins). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied. To play, both players reveal their chosen shape simultaneously, and the winner is decided based on the rules. The game is often played in a best-of-three format to determine the overall winner. The game's simplicity and unpredictability make it enjoyable for all ages and a quick and fun way to make decisions or settle disputes</p>
